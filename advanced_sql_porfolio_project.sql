-- ðŸ›’ E-COMMERCE DATABASE PROJECT
-- Author: [Your Name]
-- Story: I built this project to simulate a small
-- online shop. My goal was to design the schema, 
-- insert realistic sample data, and then run SQL 
-- analytics to uncover useful business insights.
-------------------------------------------------

-- ------------------------------------------------
-- 0. DROP & RECREATE DATABASE
-- I dropped and recreated the database because 
-- I wanted a clean slate each time I rerun the script.
-- This avoids conflicts with existing tables or data.
-- ------------------------------------------------
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS ecommerce_db;
CREATE DATABASE ecommerce_db;
USE ecommerce_db;

-- ------------------------------------------------
-- 1. CREATE TABLES
-- I designed normalized tables to represent real-world 
-- e-commerce data: customers, products, orders, 
-- order items, and payments. 
-- This structure mirrors how online shops actually work.
-- ------------------------------------------------

-- Customers: I store basic customer info with unique emails
CREATE TABLE customers (
    customer_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    full_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Products: I track product details including stock levels
CREATE TABLE products (
    product_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    product_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    category VARCHAR(50),
    price DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    stock INT NOT NULL CHECK (stock >= 0)
);

-- Orders: I link customers to their purchases
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT NOT NULL REFERENCES customers(customer_id),
    order_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'PENDING',
    total_amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL
);

-- Order Items: I added this to handle multi-product orders
CREATE TABLE order_items (
    order_item_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    order_id INT NOT NULL REFERENCES orders(order_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    product_id INT NOT NULL REFERENCES products(product_id),
    quantity INT NOT NULL CHECK (quantity > 0),
    unit_price DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL
);

-- Payments: I store payment details to track transactions
CREATE TABLE payments (
    payment_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    order_id INT NOT NULL REFERENCES orders(order_id),
    payment_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    payment_method VARCHAR(50),
    status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'SUCCESS'
);

-- ------------------------------------------------
-- 2. INSERT SAMPLE DATA
-- I inserted 5 customers, 5 products, and orders across 
-- Janâ€“Apr 2023. I chose realistic values so that the 
-- analytics queries later would reveal meaningful insights.
