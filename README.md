 📊 Data Analytics Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Analytics Portfolio! This repository showcases a collection of projects that reflect my skills in data analysis, business intelligence, and data storytelling using a variety of tools including:

* **SQL** – for data extraction, cleaning, and transformation
* **Excel** – for quick analysis, pivot tables, and dashboards
* **Tableau** – for interactive data visualizations
* **Power BI** – for building business-focused dashboards
* **Python** – for data wrangling and basic analysis

Each folder in this repository represents an individual project and highlights a different aspect of the data analysis process – from raw data cleaning to building final dashboards.
